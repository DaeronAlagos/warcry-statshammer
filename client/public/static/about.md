# Warcry Statshammer

A tool for calculating and comparing damage outputs for **Warhammer Warcry** fighters.
If you are interested in Age of Sigmar calculations, see the sister-project [AoS-Statshammer](https://aos-statshammer.herokuapp.com)

This is a free community tool built by Damon Hook (`NoMaDhOoK`)

**Remember:** There is more to a fighter than just its damage output. This is a tool, not a definitive answer of which unit is better
